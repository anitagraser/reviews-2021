## Contents

To work on the main R Markdown file, `agile-2020-papers.Rmd`, which includes _all_ information and documentation of the reproducibility review, run (requires GNU Make, and virtualenv for Python)

```bash
make
```

Then open the Jupyter UI at the link shown in the console.
In the UI, go to "New" > "RStudio" to get an integrated development environment with the required dependencies.

The `Makefile`'s default target will create a virtual Python environment to execute [`repo2docker`](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/) using the files in this repository, notably `install.R` where you must add required R packages, and the `Dockerfile` where all system dependencies and remaining software is installed and configured.
