# Data

## Twitter data
data collection and preprocessing not reproducible, because query not given (study area?) and bot removal via external API
Twitter IDs provided, were able to hydrate 90% (with Hydrator v0.3), output as json (csv export does not work because of additional line breaks)

## GDELT data
query to recreate data given, but might cost a fee to access data; data might be downloaded if new account is created, but then again preprocessing steps missing
relevant GDELT event provided

## Hurrican tracks
links to NOAA images (?!?), again data collection and preprocessing not reproducible
relevant Hurricane data provided

# Processing

used ArcGIS Pro and RStudio to explore the data sets and scripts
repository contains several additional data sets (tables, shapefiles) and R scripts
however, their purpose or lineage is not documented and needs to be inferred through exploration and experimentation
order in which the files have to be run is unclear
R scripts needs adjustments for paths, some functions or lines of code unclear to me and creating errors in RStudio (e.g. those starting with >>>>>>> and =======), later found out that code is ALSO in the data folders
Tweets_GDeltCountiesCorrelation has a missing library load (spatstat) and then creates an error in line 21 Error in square(TweetTotal_GdeltTotal) : is.numeric(r) is not TRUE

# Results

maps impossible to recreate from data without clearer instructions as to how; solution could be to provide the ArcGIS project files
boxplots and graphs can be reproduced using the R scripts, although also here quite some additional work is required due to lack of documentation
