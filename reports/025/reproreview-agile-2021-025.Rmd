# Reproducibility reviewer notes

Started with the anonymous repo at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/450b6e01-dbad-4ce4-a249-d53e88b6ff8c/README.md I went trough the pre-requisite steps as below.
I also started applying for an academic Twitter project to handle the large number of requests. Not sure that is needed.

```{bash data, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
git clone https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs

mkvirtualenv agile-025
pip install --upgrade twarc
twarc configure
# The credentials for nordholmen have been saved to your configuration file at /home/daniel/.twarc

# following https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs#hydrating-using-twarc-cli
pip3 install tqdm

# in ./COVID-19-TweetIDs
python3 hydrate.py
```

Ran for ~ 4 hours, then threw an error:

```txt
  File "/home/daniel/.virtualenvs/agile-025/lib/python3.8/site-packages/oauthlib/common.py", line 326, in to_unicode
    return dict(((to_unicode(k, encoding), to_unicode(v, encoding)) for k, v in data))
  File "/home/daniel/.virtualenvs/agile-025/lib/python3.8/site-packages/oauthlib/common.py", line 326, in <genexpr>
    return dict(((to_unicode(k, encoding), to_unicode(v, encoding)) for k, v in data))
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/_collections_abc.py", line 743, in __iter__
    for key in self._mapping:
  File "/home/daniel/.virtualenvs/agile-025/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests/structures.py", line 60, in __iter__
    return (casedkey for casedkey, mappedvalue in self._store.values())
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

Luckily, `hydrate.py` skips existing files, so I just restarted the process.

```{bash data, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
python3 hydrate.py
```


CONTINUE HERE WITH UNZIPPING, THEN RESTART COMPOSE CONFIG AND START INDEXING



Now I started Elasticsearch, following https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/master/get-started-docker.html and adjusting paths and the host in `logstash-config/{json.conf,twitter_template.json}`, which I manually downloaded from the anonymous repository.

```{bash elasticsearch, eval=FALSE, size="scriptsize"}
docker-compose up -d

docker exec -it log01 /bin/bash
# in the container:
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-rest
#Using bundled JDK: /usr/share/logstash/jdk
#OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Option UseConcMarkSweepGC was deprecated in version 9.0 and will likely be removed in a future release.
#Validating logstash-filter-rest
#Installing logstash-filter-rest
#Installation successful

# add mount points, restart log01 container, then exec into the container
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/json.conf


```

**ISSUE:** The provided information to run the "main script" is not sufficient.

```{bash mainscript, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
python COVID-19-TweetIDS-ES-Analyse.py

???
```

# Comments to the authors

- Good job using anonymous.4open.science!
- Please add information to the README regarding data sizes and expetec runtimes! When I started cloning the Echen repo, I did not expect to download gigabytes of data.
- Please provide clear usage instructions in the README, including a list of table mapping scripts/commands to each figure in the manuscript (How can I recreate Figure x?)
- You can also add repository from GitHub in your own `requirements.txt` file and make installation of twarc easier, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/35998253/261210
- A more suitable page for installing twarc would be https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Please provide direct links to installation instructions for the ELK stack - IMO a ready-to-use `docker-compose` configuration would be a good idea, the one I used is published in the reproduction material; also, specify the Elasticsearch version that you used.
- CeCILL-B free software license agreement uncommon, if possible use more generally known and understood licenses (I understand this choice might be out of your control); note that the license actually partly deanonymises you
